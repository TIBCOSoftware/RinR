In the event of a refund, this Agreement shall terminate solely with respect to the affected Software product, and you shall immediately cease all use of and return or destroy all copies of such Software.

ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS, AND WARRANTIES INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, SATISFACTORY QUALITY OR ARISING FROM A COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE, OR TRADE PRACTICE, ARE HEREBY EXCLUDED TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

17.	Indemnity. If you obtained the Software from us directly, then we agree at our own expense to defend or, at our option, to settle, any claim or action brought against you to the extent it is based on a claim that the unmodified Software infringes any patent issued by the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan, or any member of the European Union, or any copyright, or any trade secret of a third party.

In no event shall you settle any claim, action or proceeding without our prior written approval. In the event of any such claim, litigation or threat thereof, we, at our sole option and expense, shall (a) procure for you the right to continue to use the Software, or (b) replace or modify the Software with functionally equivalent software. If such license or modification is not commercially reasonable (in our sole reasonable opinion), we may cancel this Agreement with respect to the affected Software product upon sixty days prior written notice to you and refund to you the unamortized portion of the associated license fees paid by you to us based on a five-year straight-line depreciation. This Section states our entire liability with respect to the infringement of any intellectual property rights, and you hereby expressly waive any other liabilities or obligations we have with respect thereto. The foregoing indemnity shall not apply to the extent that (x) any claim is based on or attributable to  modifications made by you to the Software, or portions thereof, (y) such claim would have been avoided by use of the then-current release version of the Software, or (z) your continued allegedly infringing activity after being provided with modifications that would have avoided the alleged infringement.

C. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY EVEN IF THE ABOVE-STATED REMEDY OR LIMITED WARRANTY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LOCAL LAW, THESE LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY REGARDLESS OF THE BASIS OF LIABILITY, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, MISREPRESENTATION, BREACH OF ANY KIND, OR ANY OTHER CLAIMS IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE.

19.	Confidentiality. 

A.

The parties further agree that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for a breach of confidentiality. The parties shall be entitled to seek injunctive or other equitable relief without the necessity of posting a bond even if otherwise normally required.

Neither the license to use granted in this Agreement nor the obligation to pay license fees are dependent upon the performance by any party of any Consulting Services or the supply of any other software program or product. 

23.	Termination. 

A. This Agreement and all Order Forms shall automatically terminate if: (i) either party files for bankruptcy, or otherwise goes into receivership, becomes insolvent or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors; or (ii) a writ of attachment or execution is levied on the Equipment (where we are lessor) and is not released or satisfied within ten (10) days thereafter, or (iii) where we are lessor or in a Purchase where payment in full to us has not been made, if a receiver is appointed in any proceeding or action to which you are a party with authority to take possession or control of the Equipment.  In all cases, the Equipment shall be promptly returned to us and not be treated as your asset. 

B. Maintenance or Consulting Services may be terminated: (i) by either party upon a default of the other, such default remaining uncured for fifteen (15) days from written notice from the non-defaulting party; (ii) upon the filing for bankruptcy or insolvency of the other party, (iii) by either party upon prior written notice at least sixty (60) days prior to the end of any annual Maintenance term; or (iv) by you for Consulting Services, upon ten (10) days prior written notice or (e)  by us for Consulting Services upon thirty (30) days prior written notice. Termination of Maintenance or Consulting Services shall not terminate this Agreement.

C. A Cloud will terminate if or when your or our agreement for services with a Provider is terminated or otherwise expires for any reason. In the event of a termination of your Provider services, by Provider, in connection with a Cloud, without cause (where you are not in breach), to the extent you have pre-paid us fees for the Cloud, you may submit written notice requesting a refund, such notice to include evidence of Provider's termination without cause (e.g. a copy of Provider's notice of termination). Following receipt of such written notice, we will refund the pre-paid unearned pro-rata portion, from the date we received your notice, for the remaining Cloud term, or in the case of multiple Cloud purchases, each remaining term.  In the event of a termination, for any reason, of TIBCO Provider service accounts upon which we rely to provide Hosted Services or the Cloud, to the extent you have pre-paid us fees for Hosted Services or Cloud to us, we will refund, as of the date of notice of termination from Provider to us, for the unearned pro-rata portion of the prepaid fees.  

D.  You may terminate this Agreement in its entirety at any time, in regard to Software, by destroying all copies of the Software. We may terminate this Agreement at any time, in regard to Software provided to you for evaluation or alpha/beta purposes.  In the case of an evaluation of Equipment, where we exercise our right to terminate the Lease for a reason other than your breach of the Agreement, and you have pre-paid fees for the month in which our termination occurs, we will refund the unearned monthly pro-rated fee to you within thirty (30) days following our receipt of the returned Equipment.
 
E. If a license, Cloud, Hosted Services or Lease under this Agreement terminates or expires, or upon termination of this Agreement in its entirety for any reason, you shall (i) cease using the Products, Documentation, and related Confidential Information, and (ii) return or notify us in writing within thirty (30) days after termination that you have destroyed any Software (excluding Equipment), Documentation, related Confidential Information, and all copies thereof, whether or not modified or merged into other materials.  Equipment shall be returned in good repair, condition and working order (ordinary wear and tear resulting from proper use thereof excepted), by delivering the Equipment to our designated carrier. You are responsible for all costs associated with de-installation of equipment and returning the Equipment in accordance with the Equipment Return Guidelines available at http://www.tibco.com/resources/equipment_return_guidelines.pdf. 

F. Termination of this Agreement, any license, Cloud, Hosted Services or Lease, or any Order Form shall not limit either party from pursuing other remedies available to it, including injunctive relief, nor shall such termination relieve you of your obligation to pay all fees that have accrued or are otherwise owed by you under this Agreement.  Except as set forth in sections entitled "Termination", "Limited Warranty" or "Indemnity", all fees paid under or in connection with this Agreement are non-refundable and no right of set-off exists. The parties' rights and obligations under this section and sections entitled "Limited Warranty", "Indemnity", "Limitation of Liability", "Proprietary Notices", "Confidentiality", "General", "Governing Law" and your warranties in connection with Hosted Services and the Cloud, shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement.

24. Open Source Software. If you use any third party software not supplied by us, including any open source software, in conjunction with any Product, you must ensure that such use does not require any of the following, pursuant to the terms of such software: (i) disclosure or distribution of any Product in source code form; or (ii) licensing of any Product for the purpose of making derivative works; or (iii) redistribution of any Product at no charge. For the avoidance of doubt, you may not combine Product with any software licensed under any version of or derivative of the GNU General Public License ("GPL") in any manner that could cause, or could be interpreted or asserted to cause, the Product or any modifications to the Product to become subject to the terms of the GPL.

25.	Special Product Provisions. Software products TIBCO BusinessEvents®, TIBCO Collaborative Information Manager™, TIBCO ActiveMatrix® Service Performance Manager and TIBCO® ActiveFulfillment (and each of the foregoing, when included in any Bundle or Embedded/ Bundled Products) are subject to a restricted license and contain third party proprietary code that you may only use in conjunction with the Software and may be subject to additional terms as provided by us.

26.	General. All payments of fees due shall be made in U.S. dollars, net 30 from Purchase Date or, for any other amounts coming due hereafter, net 30 from our invoice. Fees do not include sales, use, withholding, value-added or similar taxes, and you agree to pay all sales, use, value-added, goods and services, consumption, withholding, excise and any other similar taxes or government charges, exclusive of our income tax. You agree to pay all reasonable costs incurred (including reasonable attorneys' fees) in collecting past due amounts. Except as set forth in the sections entitled "Limited Warranty", "Indemnity" and "Termination" all fees paid under or in connection with this Agreement are non-refundable and no right of set-off exists. A service charge of one and one-half percent (1 ½%) per month will be applied to all invoices that are not paid on time. No delay in the performance of any obligation by either party, excepting all obligations to make payment, shall constitute a breach of this Agreement to the extent caused by Force Majeure. You hereby grant us and our independent auditors the right to audit your compliance with this Agreement and report any results to our licensors. You agree to provide reasonable assistance to ensure a complete and accurate audit by us and our independent auditors. If any portion of this Agreement is found to be void or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.  All notices related to this Agreement shall be in writing. Notices will be effective if dispatched by facsimile; or electronic mail; by hand; reliable overnight delivery service or first-class, pre-paid mail if sent to the contract address for the intended recipient set forth in the Order Form. A copy of any notice of default, breach or termination shall also being sent to that party's General Counsel.

27.	Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, United States of America, as if performed wholly within the state and without giving effect to the principles of conflict of law. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act are excluded from application hereto.

      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable

      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,

      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

  See below for the actual license texts. Actually both licenses are BSD-style
  Open Source licenses. In case of any license issues related to OpenSSL
  please contact openssl-core@openssl.org.
